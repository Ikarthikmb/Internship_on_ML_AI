# Algorithms on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence 

This place is a workspace for learning Artificial Intelligence ,Machine Learning, and Deep Learning as a part of my course.

## Artificial Intelligence:
Definition from  Wikipedia, " Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. "

## Machine Learning:
From Wiki,  " Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. "

## Deep Learning:
From Wiki ,"  Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that use multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from raw input ."  For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layer may identify human-meaningful items such as digits/letters or faces.
